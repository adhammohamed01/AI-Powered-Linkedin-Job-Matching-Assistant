Docker & Docker Compose: We containerized the backend and MongoDB services for multiple environments (development, testing, production). A custom Docker Compose file was designed for testing the application, which is integrated into our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate testing before every deployment.\n\n2. Kubernetes Orchestration: Managed the deployment of services using Kubernetes with a fully automated setup for scaling, load balancing, and handling traffic with ConfigMaps and Ingress rules. We implemented init containers to run tests before the main application starts, ensuring the system is always in a good state.\n\n3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline: Our Jenkins pipeline automates the full lifecycle of the application\u2014running tests, building Docker images, and deploying the infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible. The pipeline is built to ensure a smooth and consistent deployment process, handling everything from provisioning to configuration automatically.\n\n4. Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code: We used Terraform to provision the cloud infrastructure on Azure, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments. This included setting up VMs, virtual networks, public IPs, and security groups, giving us a robust cloud foundation.\n\n5. Ansible Automation: Post-provisioning, Ansible was used to automate server configuration, install Docker, and deploy the application using Docker Compose. This ensured a fully automated end-to-end process, bringing the application online with minimal manual intervention.\n\n6. Slack Integration: We set up real-time Slack notifications to provide instant feedback on pipeline success or failure, allowing us to quickly address any issues and improve efficiency.",
